# Hi, Welcome to my Github

There's a combination of projects for classes, hobby projects, and helpful things here for myself, feel free to browse around

## Projects:

### Fridgy Capstone:
This is the Android App in Kotlin I wrote for my Senior Design Project at Northeastern.  There was a team of five of us who created the entire project, myself and one other on the Frontend, and the rest on the Backend.  This is what I currently use as my general purpose hobby Android project and as such I'm randomly adding features to it that I'm interesting in learning.

### Covey Town Chat CS4530:
A React App written in Typescript where we extended existing functionality to add direct and group messaging using Socket.io.  The codebase was created and provided by my class CS4530 however for our final assignment our goal was to add Chat.

### Chess AI CS4100:
A Python app that is currently a work in progress.  I use negamax with various improvements to it such as alpha beta pruning.  I'm planning on writing a chess library in Kotlin and then rewriting the AI in it.

### Various other projects
I have a lot of projects from classes and side projects that are not currently uploaded here but will be eventually so stay tuned. (Unix Shell, Fuse File System, Solitare, Floodit, Animator (using Java's Swing library).
I will be releasing two Android apps from CS4520 at the end of June once the class is completed.
